<p align = "justify">STRYDE accelerates loan approvals with precision by leveraging Lorentzian Neural Networks to optimize risk assessment and decision making.

- Loan approval takes around 3-4 days from acceptance to approval, we are aiming to provide that in just a couple of hours (and will work it through for making it to minutes), without tampering with the accuracy.
- Our model provides a hybrid structure integrating Lorentzian Neural Networks along with Ensemble Methods for accuracy boost to ensure that the loan approval is handled with the atmost care.
